# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

This will be a simple implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, under The Odin Project.
Second project of the  curriculum, after going through JavaScript basics.

Started creating the repository and writing this README on August, 21, 2021.

- Update on August, 30, 2021:
  I went through the lesson on DOM manipulation (in TOP's context) and we're assigned to implement
  a basic GUI for the "rock-paper-scissors" project.
  I started doing it in another computer (not my own), so the creation of this branch, plus the big
  update to the files, were not ideal in workflow terms.
  From now on, I'll be doing smaller commits and pushes.

- Update on August, 22, 2021:
  First, I had the idea of implementing The Big Bang Theory TV show version of the game, adding 
  Lizard and Spock as choices too.
  Secondly, the implementation was faster than I thought, the game is done. In its first version, the
  code is mainly a bunch of "if... else if". I'm going to ask in TOP's discord server if there is some
  other clever way(s) of doing it, so I can improve the code and practice.
  Still, I wanted to update this version because it's indeed the solution I found myself.

  Note: as stated in comments within the code, the project proposes the game to be played in browser's 
  console, and I wrote it accordingly. It's said that I'll revisit it in the future to implement a GUI.
